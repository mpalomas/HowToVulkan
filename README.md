# How to Vulkan in 2026

Home of a minimalist tutorial on how to use the Vulkan graphics API in 2026. The idea is to get people started with rasterization in Vulkan using commonly supported features to make the API easier to use. This is a single page tutorial that can be done from top to bottom in a single day. I also tried to incorporate helpful tips, notes and warnings from my 10 years of experience working with Vulkan.
